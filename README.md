<h2>Recipe-ShareüîÅ</h2>
This is a recipe sharing web application üçÖ that is made with MERN stack. The frontend consists of adding and deleting recipes that uses Redux toolkit for global state management ‚öõÔ∏è. The authentication is powered by JWT and local storage is being implemented so that the user won't have login again and again ‚ú®. The Node.js backend uses MongoDB as the database to add, delete recipes and for authentication üîê.
